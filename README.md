# Data Analytics Learning Portfolio
Thanks for checking out my data analytics portfolio!
This is a collection of my personal data analytics projects primarily comprising SQL, Python and PowerBI.

## About Me
I am a Lead Data Analyst currently working at a management consultancy. I moved into this sector after conducting various psychological studies which employed R/RStudio for statistical analysis. I have two years professional experience working with Power BI and are a Microsoft Certified: Data Analyst Associate. I am now on a self-development journey to continuously improve!
My love for data analytics stems from partly my methodological nature and my love for solving problems! I especially enjoy meeting niche client requirements which reflect a challenge given their current state of data architecture. 
My real passions within data analytics lie in the back-end where I enjoy transforming data to a state ready for data visualisation.
